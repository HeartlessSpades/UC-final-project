Since covid came, we became more dependent on virtual and online stuff as for our educational life in university 
Almost all of us use a smart device to write our notes in the classes or even read our books in a PDF form 
Therefore, I decided that I should create an app or website to organize our digital library in each course! To find all our pdf notes and books in an easy good looking library 
In the home screen, you have two choices to choose to either upload files or read files that are already uploaded 
In my app you are able to upload PDFâ€™s by dragging the files in a box, upload them by browsing your device and uploading them using their URL (from drop box, google drive and cloud)
After uploading your desired files, you will find them in the other section (your list) you can edit them, delete them or add more.
